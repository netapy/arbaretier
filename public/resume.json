He fully fulfilled his mission by carrying out a quantitative study on employee shareholding of great quality with precision, involvement and rigor. Moreover, he went beyond by making many original and high value-added proposals, for example to create a page in JavaScript to present the results of the study in a lively and very professional way. Finally, he came up with a lot of concrete solutions, for example to improve our blog or SEO reports. Baudouin has great qualities to analyze a situation and find an optimization solution. He will make an excellent consultant and I highly recommend him!"
